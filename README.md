SimMetrics
==========

SimMetrics is a java library of Similarity or Distance Metrics, e.g. Levenshtein Distance, that provide float based similarity measures between String Data. All metrics return consistant measures rather than unbounded similarity scores. 

SimMetrics is based on the [SimMetrics Library](http://sourceforge.net/projects/simmetrics/) by Sam Chapman.
