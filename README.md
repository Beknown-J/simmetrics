SimMetrics
==========

SimMetrics is a java library of Similarity or Distance Metrics, e.g. Levenshtein Distance, that provide float based similarity measures between String Data. All metrics return consistant measures rather than unbounded similarity scores. 

SimMetrics is based on the [SimMetrics Library](http://sourceforge.net/projects/simmetrics/) by Sam Chapman.

## Example ##

```
	String str1 = "This is a sentence. It is made of words";
	String str2 = "This sentence is similair. It has almost the same words";

	StringMetric metric = StringMetrics.cosineSimilarity();

	float result = metric.compare(str1, str2); //0.4472
```

## Refactoring & Redesign ##

This fork is aimed at refactoring and cleaning up the SimMetrics project. This is done with the following aims: 

 * Support general workflow of simplication, tokenization and comparision.
 * Reduce clutter on the InterfaceSimilarityMetrics.
 * Allow caching of expensive tokenization and simplification operations.
 * Allow for easy anonymous-subclassing-style configuration.

## Workflow ##

The goal is to support a general workflow that consists of simplification, tokenization and comparision. Where applicable it should be possible to construct a similarity metric with any simplifier, tokenizer and submetric.

### Simplification ###

Simplfication increases the effectiveness of a metric by removing noise. The process maps a a complex string such as `Chilp√©ric II son of Childeric II` to a simpler format `chilperic ii son of childeric ii`. This allows string from different sources to be compared in the same normal form.

Custom simplification can added by implementing the Simplifier interface.

```
	public class NonWordCharacterSimplifier implements Simplifier {

		@Override
		public String simplify(String input) {
		    return input.replaceAll("\\W", " ");
		}
	}
```

A custom simplifier can be added onto any metric by using the StringMetricBuilder. Multiple simplifiers can be chained through the CompositeSimplifier.

```
	final String str1 = "This is a sentence. It is made of words";
	final String str2 = "This sentence is similair. It has almost the same words";

	StringMetric metric = new StringMetricBuilder()
			.setMetric(new CosineSimilarity<String>())
			.setSimplifier(new CompositeSimplifier() {
				{
					setSimplifiers(
							new CaseSimplifier.Lower(),
							new NonWordCharacterSimplifier());
				}
			})
			.setTokenizer(new WhitespaceTokenizer())
			.build();

	final float result = metric.compare(str1, str2); //0.5590
```

### Tokenization ###

Tokenization cuts up a string into tokens e.g. `[chilperic, ii, son, of, childeric, ii]`. Tokenization can also be done recursively `[ch,hi,il,il,lp,pe,er,ri,ic, ii, so,on, of, ch,hi,il,ld,de,er,ri,ic, ii]`.

Not all algorithms use tokenization but those that do such as SimonWhite, Dice and Jaccard are agnostic towards the exact method. While it eniterely feasible to let each algorithm implements its own features, there is a shared concern with regards to caching. Tokenization is expensive, being able to set a cache in a common manner allows programatic optimization when neccesary.

## Reduce Clutter ##

Many interfaces in the library contain methods that are not strictly related to the core functionality of comparing strings. This includes description strings, explanations, performance testing methods, ect. This should either be removed where redundant or refactored when usefull.

Ideally there is only a single method in the interface.

```
    public interface StringMetric {
    
        public float compare(String s1, String s2)
    
    } 
```

## Support Caching ##

Simplification and tokenization are complex and expensive operations. When comparing one string against a collection of strings these two operations are done repeatedly for a single string - a common use case when searching for a match. With a simple caching mechnism this overhead can be reduced. Being able to do this programmatically allows these to be inserted when needed.
