/**
 * Measures the similarity between two arbitrary objects of the same type . The

 * indicates that the sets are dissimilar, a value of 1 indicates they are
 * similar.
 * <p>
 * The similarity measure should be consistent with equals such that
 * {@code a.equals(b) => compare(a,b) == 1.0}.
 * <p>
 * The similarity measure should be reflexive such that
 * {@code compare(a,a) == 1.0}.
 * <p>
 * The similarity measure should be symmetric such that
 * {@code compare(a,b) == compare(b,a)}.
 * <p>
 * The similarity measure may be transitive such that
 * {@code 1.0 - compare(a, c) â‰¤ 1.0 - compare(a, b) + 1.0 - compare(b, c)}
 * <p>
 * The similarity measure may satisfy the coincidence axiom such that
 * {@code compare(a, b) = 0 if and only if a.equals(b)}
 * <p>
 * Implementations may not modify the arguments. Arguments should be treated as
